    <section class="slide" id="Background">

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <ul>
        <li class="slide" >
         Warning... a lot of text coming...
       </li>
       <li class="slide" >
        <p>In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton formulated the principles governing the the motion of two particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction in his famous <strong>Principia</strong>. However, Newton was unable to solve the problem for three particles. Indeed, in general, systems of three or more particles can only be solved numerically. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="slide" >
       ... and there is more ...
     </li>
     <li class="slide" >
      <p>Your challenge in this assignment is to write a program to simulate the motion of <strong>N </strong>particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Scientists also apply the same techniques to other pairwise interactions including Coulombic, Biot-Savart, and van der Waals.</p>
    </li>

    <li class="slide" >
      ...just read it... it will take less than a minute and is semi useful? 
    </li>

    <li class="slide" >

      <p>We provide all the formulas you need in the assignment. Don't worry if you don't fully understand them---this is neither a physics nor a math course. Instead, focus on the computer science task: building up a complicated result through a series of simple statements.</p>
    </li>
  </section>

  <!-- Requirements -->


  <section class="slide" id="Requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>When finished this assignment, you should have a program NBody.java that:</p>  
    <ul>
      <li class="slide" >
        Reads three <strong>command-line arguments</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li class="slide" >
           <strong>T</strong>, a double value that represents how long to run the simulation,  
         </li>
         <li class="slide" >
          <strong>Î”t</strong>, a double value that indicates the amount of time that elapses between simulation steps, and
        </li>
        <li class="slide" >
          <strong>filename</strong>, the filename for the data file that holds information about the universe.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="slide" >
      Reads in the universe from the file <strong>filename</strong> using In.java.
    </li>
    <li class="slide" >
      Simulates the universe, starting at time <strong>t</strong> = 0.0, and continuing as long as <strong>t < T</strong>, using the procedure describe below.
    </li>
    <li class="slide" >
     Animates the results using Processing.
   </li>
   <li class="slide" >
    Prints the state of the universe at the end of the simulation (in the same format as the input file) to <strong>standard output</strong> using System.out.println().
  </li>
  <li class="slide" >
    Your program will maintain several parallel arrays to store the data. To make the computer simulation, we will use a loop that repeatedly updates the position and velocity of the particles at each time step <strong>t</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

<section class="slide" id="Command Line Arguments">
  <h2>A Review of Command-Line Arguments</h2>
  <p class = "slide">Yes. you need to review it.  </p>
  <ul> 
    <li>For this homework and beyond, you will often have to use
      command-line arguments, which you will have to type in every
      time you run the program.</li>
      <li>Remember that command-line arguments are just an array of
        Strings that are read in automatically to your <code>main()</code>
        function. <br></br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Once <tt>PApplet.main()</tt> is called in your <tt>main()</tt>
          function, the program will not go back to <tt>main()</tt>, so
          any command-line arguments will need to be processed within <tt>main()</tt>
          but before you call <tt>PApplet.main()</tt>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Since the arguments are read in as Strings, remember also to
          use <tt>Integer.parseInt()</tt> or <tt>Double.parseDouble()</tt>
          to convert numeric arguments to whatever type you need.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <section class="slide" id="Command Line Arguments part 2">
    <h2>A Review of Command-Line Arguments: 
      Take 2</h2>
      <p class = "slide">Yes. read it.  </p>
      <p class = "slide">Read it. But where is this OnionAdder? -> NOW PRESS THE ARROW!  </p>
      <li>Try out the program <tt>OnionAdder</tt> to see how
        command-line arguments work. <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to pass command line arguments into your program,
          you must use Dr. Java's interactions pane to run the
          program.&nbsp; You can run the program by going to the
          interactions pane and typing the following command: <tt>java
          OnionAdder 300 55.532</tt><br>
        </li>
        <li>Let's take a look at the code in the <tt>OnionAdder.java</tt>
          program. Notice that putting a "+" sign between <tt>args[0]</tt>
          and <tt>args[1]</tt> concatenates the strings; the program
          needs to convert the inputs to integers or doubles before it
          can perform calculations with them.</li>
