    <h2>Background</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="slide" >
       Warning... a lot of text coming...
     </li>
     <li class="slide" >
      <p>In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton formulated the principles governing the the motion of two particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction in his famous Principia. However, Newton was unable to solve the problem for three particles. Indeed, in general, systems of three or more particles can only be solved numerically. </p>
    </li>
    <li class="slide" >
     ... and there is more ...
   </li>
   <li class="slide" >
    <p>Your challenge in this assignment is to write a program to simulate the motion of N particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Scientists also apply the same techniques to other pairwise interactions including Coulombic, Biot-Savart, and van der Waals.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="slide" >
    ...just read it... it will take less than a minute and is semi useful? 
  </li>

  <li class="slide" >

    <p>We provide all the formulas you need in the assignment. Don't worry if you don't fully understand them---this is neither a physics nor a math course. Instead, focus on the computer science task: building up a complicated result through a series of simple statements.</p>
  </li>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="Requirements">
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>When finished this assignment, you should have a program NBody.java that:</p>  
  <ul>
    <li class="slide" >
      Reads three command-line arguments:
      <ul>
        <li class="slide" >
         T, a double value that represents how long to run the simulation,  
       </li>
       <li class="slide" >
        Î”t, a double value that indicates the amount of time that elapses between simulation steps, and
       </li>
       <li class="slide" >
        filename, the filename for the data file that holds information about the universe.
       </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
<li class="slide" >




  Reads in the universe from the file filename using In.java.
  Simulates the universe, starting at time t = 0.0, and continuing as long as t < T, using the procedure describe below.
  Animates the results using Processing.
  Prints the state of the universe at the end of the simulation (in the same format as the input file) to standard output using System.out.println().
  Your program will maintain several parallel arrays to store the data. To make the computer simulation, we will use a loop that repeatedly updates the position and velocity of the particles at each time step t.
   </li>
</ul>
