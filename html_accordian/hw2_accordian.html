    <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
    <div class="accordian">
      <h3>Background</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        <p>In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton formulated the principles governing the the motion of two particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction in his famous <strong>Principia</strong>. However, Newton was unable to solve the problem for three particles. Indeed, in general, systems of three or more particles can only be solved numerically.</p><p> <img src="http://newtontime.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/9/9/14990736/7172854_orig.jpg" alt=" AND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW KNEWTON" style="height:100px"></p>
        <p>Your challenge in this assignment is to write a program to simulate the motion of <strong>N </strong>particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Scientists also apply the same techniques to other pairwise interactions including Coulombic, Biot-Savart, and van der Waals.</p>
        <p>We provide all the formulas you need in the assignment. Don't worry if you don't fully understand them---this is neither a physics nor a math course. Instead, focus on the computer science task: building up a complicated result through a series of simple statements.</p>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <div>
      <p>When finished this assignment, you should have a program NBody.java that:</p>  
      <ul>
        <li>
         <strong>T</strong>, a double value that represents how long to run the simulation,  
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>Δt</strong>, a double value that indicates the amount of time that elapses between simulation steps, and
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>filename</strong>, the filename for the data file that holds information about the universe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reads in the universe from the file <strong>filename</strong> using In.java.
      </li>
      <li >
        Simulates the universe, starting at time <strong>t</strong> = 0.0, and continuing as long as <strong>t < T</strong>, using the procedure described later.
      </li>
      <li >
       Animates the results using Processing.
     </li>
     <li>
      Prints the state of the universe at the end of the simulation (in the same format as the input file) to <strong>standard output</strong> using System.out.println().
    </li>
    <li>
      Your program will maintain several parallel arrays to store the data. To make the computer simulation, we will use a loop that repeatedly updates the position and velocity of the particles at each time step <strong>t</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>A Review of Command-Line Arguments</h3>
<div>
 <ul> 
    <li>For this homework and beyond, you will often have to use
      command-line arguments, which you will have to type in every
      time you run the program.</li>
      <li>Remember that command-line arguments are just an array of
        Strings that are read in automatically to your <code>main()</code>
        function. 
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Once <tt>PApplet.main()</tt> is called in your <tt>main()</tt>
          function, the program will not go back to <tt>main()</tt>, so
          any command-line arguments will need to be processed within <tt>main()</tt>
          but before you call <tt>PApplet.main()</tt>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Since the arguments are read in as Strings, remember also to
          use <tt>Integer.parseInt()</tt> or <tt>Double.parseDouble()</tt>
          to convert numeric arguments to whatever type you need.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Try out the program <tt>OnionAdder</tt> to see how
        command-line arguments work. 
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to pass command line arguments into your program,
          you must use Dr. Java's interactions pane to run the
          program.&nbsp; You can run the program by going to the
          interactions pane and typing the following command: <tt>java
          OnionAdder 300 55.532</tt>
        </li>
        <li>Let's take a look at the code in the <tt>OnionAdder.java</tt>
          program. Notice that putting a "+" sign between <tt>args[0]</tt>
          and <tt>args[1]</tt> concatenates the strings; the program
          needs to convert the inputs to integers or doubles before it
          can perform calculations with them.</li>

          <h2>Java Visualizer for Onion Adder</h2></li>
        <li><p>Add 2 command line arguments, 300 and 55.532, before clicking "visualize execution".</p></li>
        <li><p>Press "forward" to step through each line of the program.  Press "last" to skip to the end</p>
         <p>Output will be at the bottom, and the visualization will be on the right</p>
       </li>

<h3>General Structure of the N-Body Program</h3>
<div>
 <p> 
  We will be building up the program in several steps.&nbsp; Be
  certain to debug and test your program as you go.&nbsp; Even if you
  have not yet gotten to steps with graphical output, you can test
  your program easily by adding in temporary println()
  statements.&nbsp; If you read in a variable, print its value out to
  check it.&nbsp; If you do a computation, print out the result and
  check it.&nbsp; Once you're certain it is correct, you can remove
  these temporary println() statements.
</p>
<p> 
  The general structure of the program will be as shown below.&nbsp;
  The comments that are in <font color="#ff0000">RED</font> denote
  parts of the program that you will need to fill in.&nbsp; The
  purpose of this outline is to show you where each of the parts of
  the program will go:
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    import processing.core.*; <br> <br>public class NBody extends PApplet { <br> <br>    public static void main(String[] args) { <br>  <br>        <font color="#ff0000">// process command line arguments and initialize variables (Part I)</font><br><br>        <font color="#ff0000">// read in the universe file (Part I)</font><br><br>        // start running the simulation<br>        PApplet.main(new String[]{"NBody"});  <br>    } <br><br><br>    <font color="#ff0000">// class-level variables</font><br><br>    public void setup() {<br>        <font color="#ff0000">// setup your sketch (Part II)</font><br><br>        <font color="#ff0000">// load in all images used in your simulation</font><font color="#ff0000"> (Part II)</font><code></code><br>    }<br>    <br>    public void draw() {<br>        <font color="#ff0000">// simulate one time step of the simulation (Part III)<br></font>    }<br>
  }</pre>
</code>
</div>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<div>
  <ol>
   <li> Create a file <tt>NBody.java</tt> that will be your
    submission for this assignment. Copy the template for using the
    Processing library into the file.
  </li>
  <li>Download <a
    href="provided_files/nbody_data.zip">nbody_data.zip</a>
    and unzip it into the same folder as <tt>NBody.java</tt>. If
    your computer puts the contents in an nbody_data folder, move
    all the unzipped files back into the same folder as your <tt>NBody.java</tt>.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Read Section 1.5. Review <code>StudentsFileProcessor.java</code>
      included in the zip file for help with reading from a file and
      parallel arrays. Compile and execute this program to make sure
      your system is configured properly. You can use the included
      file <code >students.txt</code> as input:
      <pre><b>% java StudentsFileProcessor students.txt</b></pre>
      If you have trouble compiling <code>StudentsFileProcessor.java</code>,
      check the Common Problems section. The booksite's standard
      library may not be correctly configured on your computer.
    </li>

<h3>Let's get this party started!</h3>
     <p><img src="http://cafewitteveen.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tumblr_m0ni29eugr1qewacoo1_500.png" style="height: 200px"/></p>
</div> <!--end fragment-->


<!--NEW TAB-->
<div id="part1">
<h3>Reading Input </h3>
<div class="accordian">
  <h3>Variable for Filename</h3>
<div>
  <li>The first step is to declare a class-level variable for the
    filename (remember that class-level variables go outside of <code>setup()</code>,
    <code>draw()</code>, <code>main()</code>, etc. so that they
    are available in all of these functions):<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static String filename;</code><br>
    In this case, we also need to make the variable
    "static".&nbsp; Although we'll go over the details about <code>static</code>
    in a few more weeks, essentially static methods (like <code>main()</code>)
    can only access static variables.&nbsp; Since <code>main()</code>
    is static and we'll be setting the variable <code>filename</code>
    in <code>main()</code>, we have to make the variable <code>filename
  </code>static too.</li>
  <li>Add code to the beginning of<code> main()</code> that will
    initialize <code>filename</code> using the 3rd command line
    argument (<code>args[2]</code>).</li>
    <li>As a test, temporarily print out the value of <code>filename
    </code>immediately after you initialize it to make certain
    that it was read in correctly.</li>
    <li>Make certain that the call to <code>PApplet.main() </code>is
      the very last command in <code>main()</code>.&nbsp; This will
      start your simulation, and so any code after this in <code>main()</code>
      will not be called.</li>
      <li>Run your program to test it from the interactions pane in
        Dr. Java.&nbsp; Note that we're ignoring the two numbers
        passed into the program for now.&nbsp; To run your program,
        type:
        <p> <b><tt>% java NBody 15778000.0 25000.0 planets.txt</tt></b>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Check that it read in the filename correctly and printed it
        out.<br>
      </li>
      <li><font color="red"><b>Do not continue until you have tested
        and debugged this part.</b></font></li>
      </div>

      <h3>Reading from a file</h3>
      <div>
        <li>The next step is to read in
            the file describing the universe we will simulate.&nbsp; We will
            store this information into variables for use in our program. <br>
            The booksite's standard library provides the file <code>In.java</code>
            to support reading from a file.&nbsp; For a detailed example of
            reading from a file, you should consult <code>StudentsFileProcessor.java</code>.&nbsp;
            However, this section provides an overview of the necessary steps:
          </li>
          <li>Declare and initialize a variable in <code>main()</code>
            (we'll call it
            <code> inStream</code> in this example) to read from the file:<br></li>
           <li> <blockquote><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In inStream = new
              In(filename);&nbsp; // creates a variable inStream that we
              can use to read from the file</pre></blockquote></li>

              <li>Once the input stream is initialized, you can read from it
                using the following commands, just as with <code>StdIn</code>
                (see Section 1.5 of the textbook):</li>
                <ul>
                  <blockquote>
                    <pre>Section 1.5
                  boolean b = inStream.isEmpty();     // boolean value that is true if there are no more values, false otherwise
                  int i     = inStream.readInt();     // reads in an int from inStream
                  double d  = inStream.readDouble();  // reads in a double from inStream
                  boolean b = inStream.readBoolean(); // reads in a boolean from inStream
                  String s  = inStream.readString();  // reads in a string from inStream
                  String s  = inStream.readLine();    // reads in an entire line from inStream
                  String s  = inStream.readAll();     // reads in the entire file from inStream
                          </pre>
                        </blockquote>
                        <li>
                            The next step is to actually read in the file.&nbsp; To do
                            this, we'll need to understand the format of the file's
                            contents:<br>
                            <b>Input format.</b> The information for the universe is
                            contained in a text file with the following format:</li>
                            <ol>
                             <li> The first value is an integer <font color="blue"><b>N</b></font>
                              that represents the number of particles. </li>
                              <li> The second value is a real number <font color="blue"><b>R</b></font>
                                that represents the <em>radius</em> of the universe: assume
                                all particles will have <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinates

                                that remain between -<em>R</em> and <em>R</em>. </li>
                                <li> The remaining <em>N</em> rows, each contain 6 values.
                                  The first two are the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinates

                                  of the initial position (<font color="blue"><b>px[]</b></font>
                                  and <font color="blue"><b>py[]</b></font>); the second two
                                  are the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-components of the
                                  initial velocity (<font color="blue"><b>vx[]</b></font> and
                                  <font color="blue"><b>vy[]</b></font>); the fifth is the
                                  mass (<font color="blue"><b>m[]</b></font>); the last is a <tt>String</tt>
                                  that is the name of an image file used to display the
                                  particle (<font color="blue"><b>imgNames[]</b></font>). As
                                  an example, <tt>planets.txt</tt> contains data for our
                                  solar system (in SI units). </li></ol>

                        in the limited Processing sketch window.
                        <li class="slide">To transform between the universe coordinates and Processing window coordinates for the display, use the formulas below. The universe coordinates

                          also have to cast these values into floats and negate the y

    <h3>Making the Planets Move</h3>
      <div class="accordian">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <div>
         <p>The motion of particles is governed by a set
          of equations known as Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. (At
          the scale of the galaxy, we can treat planets as particles.) The
          equations contain two basic parts: <i>velocity</i>, which is the
          speed and direction that a particle is moving, and <i>acceleration</i>
          which are changes to speed and acceleration. Particles always move
          in a straight line at a constant speed unless some outside force
          (e.g. friction, gravity, or a push) creates an acceleration that
          changes the speed or direction. In our simulations, the only force
          will be gravity. First, however, we suggest implementing a
          universe without gravity and testing to make sure this works. </p></p>
         </section>
         <section class="slide">
          <p > Although we think of time as advancing continuously and of
            objects as moving continuously, computers are not good at
            simulating constant change. Instead, we settle for letting time
            jump forward in discrete time steps of Δ<i>t</i>, measured in
            seconds, called the <i>time quantum</i>. Particles will simply
            jump from the old position to the new position at each time step.
            By settings Δ<i>t</i> very small, we can get a very accurate
            simulation, but will need to do an enormous number of
            computations. Setting it very large will make the simulation very
            fast, but not very accurate. The scheme for doing this simulation,
            which we describe in detail below, is called the <i>leapfrog
            finite difference approximation scheme</i>. It numerically
            integrate Newton's equations (don't worry if that statement is
            meaningless to you), and is the basis for most astrophysical
            simulations of gravitational systems. </p>

              time at which your simulation should end (the end of the
              universe, if you will), and <tt>dt</tt> is the amount of
              time that should pass in each step of your simulation.<br>
              (The latter is normally written "Δt" in formulas, but

                Because <tt>T</tt> and <tt>dt</tt> are command-line
                arguments, rather than part of the input file, you can
                simulate the same universe at different speeds and for

                    increase it to speed up the animation or decrease it to slow
                    the animation down. Without it, your animation may flicker,

          <div>
<ul>
    <li> <h5>Gravitational Forces (Background):</h5> To update the
      particle velocities at each time step, you need to to
      compute the gravitational forces. Since the force depends on
      the relative positions of particles, it changes constantly
      and must be inside your time loop. On the other hand, you
      need it to update the velocities and therefore the
      positions, so it must come at the beginning of the time
      loop. The acceleration of a single particle, say the planet
      Earth, is simply the sum of forces exerted by all other
      planets on it (the <i>principle of superposition</i>). For
      each planet, you will need a loop over all other planets to
      sum up the force they exert on it. You will need to do this
      for all planets. </li>

    </section>
    <section class="slide" >
      <li> <h5>Gravitational Forces (Scaffolding Code):</h5> For now,
        assume the force that any planet exerts on any other planet
        is 0. (You will update this in the following steps.) Write
        code to compute the total force on each planet by summing up
        the pairwise forces (each planet with every other planet) as
        described above. The result will of course be zero, but will
        let you focus on the pairwise forces in the next step. <font

      <section class="slide">
        <li> <h5>Pairwise Gravitational Forces:</h5> The formula for
          the pairwise force <b>F</b> that one particle exerts on
          another is known as <i>Newton's law of universal
          gravitation</i>. It is the gravitational constant
          6.67&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;Nm<sup>2</sup>/kg<sup>2</sup>
          times the product of the two particles' masses, divided by
          the squared distance between them. The following figure illustrates
          the formula, using the Earth and the sun as representative

          forces <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> using
          the formulas from the figure. Don't try and write this as

                gravitational pull of every other particle. </li>
                <li class="slide"> <h5>Order of computation:</h5> Remember that you must
                  update the velocity of <b>every</b> particle before you can
                  update any positions. Even though your program computes
                  these velocities one after the other, you have to maintain
                  the <i>illusion</i> that all planets are moving at the same
                  time. For instance, if you update the Earth's position
                  before computing Mars's velocity, then you will end up
                  computing Mars's velocity based on Earth's <i>future</i>
                  position, rather than its current position. </li>

          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <div>
            <li> <b>Testing:</b> Compile and run your program. The
            planets should now orbit the sun. When testing, you should
            start with a single time step, making sure that it is
            working completely. Then try a small number of time steps,
            again making certain that it is working completely, before
            going on to a full year. It is much easier to diagnose
            problems for smaller time frames.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="slide"> After completing this section, review the requirements in <b>Your
        Program</b> at the top of this page, and make sure you are
        fulfilling the requirements exactly. Continue testing with other
        input files. </p>

    <h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>
    <div>
      <div class="accordian">
      <h3>Sound</h3>
      <div>
      <p class="slide"> For an optional finishing touch, play the theme to <em>2001: A
        Space Odyssey</em> using StdAudio and the file <tt>2001.mid</tt>.
        You only need to add one line of code to the end of <tt>setup()</tt>
        to play the music: <br>
        <tt>StdAudio.play("2001.mid")</tt><br>
        On some computers, this adds a delay when the program starts up. For
        this reason, we recommended adding sound only when everything else
        works. It's entirely optional and not worth any points.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>More Precise Testing</h3>
      <div>
         <p> On the next slide there are the outputs your program should print after running on
            the <tt>planets.txt</tt> for various lengths of time. <b>Make
            sure you are printing your output at the very end of the program
            before comparing to these.</b> The exact numbers you get may be
            slightly different than the ones below if you do your computations
            in a slightly different order than our solution. <b>This is fine</b>,
            and is caused by rounding errors that affect the results
            differently depending on the precise order of statements. Also
            check to make sure that you are incrementing t after checking
            whether the universe should stop. <b>The biggest errors will
            appear to be in the sun's position.</b> Don't worry; all the
            values are printed in scientific notation. The planets' positions
            all end in <tt>e+10</tt> or <tt>e+11</tt>, meaning you should
            multiple the numbers by 10<sup>10</sup> or 10<sup>11</sup>. The
            exponents on the sun's position are on the scale of 10<sup>5</sup>.
            An error in the leading digit of the sun's position is therefore
            miniscule compared to the planet positions. Another way to think
            about this is that the window is 500&nbsp;×&nbsp;500 pixels,
            representing coordinates ranging from -2.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>11</sup>
            to 2.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>11</sup>. Even if the leading digit of
            the sun's position is off by one, the error is on the order of
            10000, which is far less than one pixel in the window!</p>

            <h3>I'm a physicist. Why should I use the leapfrog method
              instead of the formula I derived in high school? In other
              words, why does the position update formula use the velocity
              at the <em>updated</em> time step rather than the previous
              one? Why not use the 1/2 a t^2 formula?</h3>
            <div>
          The leapfrog
            method is more stable for integrating Hamiltonian systems than
            conventional numerical methods like Euler's method or
            Runge-Kutta. The leapfrog method is <em>symplectic</em>, which
            means it preserves properties specific to Hamiltonian systems
            (conservation of linear and angular momentum,
            time-reversibility, and conservation of energy of the discrete
            Hamiltonian). In contrast, ordinary numerical methods become
            dissipative and exhibit qualitatively different long-term
            behavior. For example, the earth would slowly spiral into (or
            away from) the sun. For these reasons, symplectic methods are
            extremely popular for N-body calculations in practice. (Yeah,
            it's a bit complex.&nbsp; Hey, you asked!)
            <p> Here's a more complete explanation of how you should
              interpret the variables. The classic <em>Euler method</em>
              updates the position uses the velocity at time <em>t</em>
              instead of using the updated velocity at time <em>t</em> + Δ<em>t</em>.
              A better idea is to use the velocity at the midpoint <em>t</em>
              + Δ<em>t</em> / 2. The leapfrog method does this in a clever
              way. It maintains the position and velocity one-half time step
              out of phase: At the beginning of an iteration, (<em>p<sub>x</sub></em>,
              <em>p<sub>y</sub></em>) represents the position at time <em>t</em>
              and (<em>v<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>v<sub>y</sub></em>)
              represents the velocity at time <em>t</em> - Δt / 2.
              Interpreting the position and velocity in this way, the
              updated position (<em>p<sub>x</sub></em> + Δ<em>t</em> <em>v<sub>x</sub></em>,
              <em>p<sub>y</sub></em> + Δ<em>t</em> <em>v<sub>y</sub></em>).
              uses the velocity at time <em>t</em> + Δt / 2. Almost
              magically, the only special care needed to deal with the half
              time-steps is to initialize the system's velocity at time <em>t</em>
              = -Δ<em>t</em> / 2 (instead of <em>t</em> = 0.0), and you can
              assume that we have already done this for you. Note also that
              the acceleration is computed at time <em>t</em> so that when
              we update the velocity, we are using the acceleration at the
              midpoint of the interval under consideration. </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div>
               <li>N-body simulations play a crucial role in our understanding of
            the universe. Astrophysicists use it to study stellar dynamics
            at the galactic center, stellar dynamics in a globular cluster,
            colliding galaxies, and the formation of the structure of the
            Universe. The strongest evidence we have for the belief that
            there is a black hole in the center of the Milky Way comes from
            very accurate N-body simulations. Many of the problems that
            astrophysicists want to solve have millions or billions of
            particles. More sophisticated computational techniques are
            needed.
          <li class="slide">The same methods are also widely used in molecular dynamics,
            except that the heavenly bodies are replaced by atoms, gravity
            is replaced by some other force, and the leapfrog method is
            called <em>Verlet's method</em>. With van der Waals forces, the
            interaction energy may decay as 1/R^6 instead of an inverse
            square law. Occasionally, 3-way interactions must be taken into
            account, e.g., to account for the covalent bonds in diamond
            crystals.

            You have probably flipped the order of particles when computing
              Δ<i>x</i> and Δ<i>y</i>. As a result, the signs on all your
              distances are all reversed, and gravity is repelling planets
              from each other instead of attracting them. (Video is slowed for

                  computation by hand to see exactly what it would give you. That
                  should help you understand why this is a bad idea, and why the

            <p>You are not summing up the pairwise forces
                  correctly. Run your program with a small value of <tt>T</tt>
                  (e.g. 51000) so it runs for only two or three time steps. Print
                  out the value of every variable before and after you change its
                  value (or right after you first initialize it). Include enough
                  information in the print statement so you can tell which
                  variable you are printing out. Make sure to print all loop
                  variables as well so you can tell from the output exactly when
                  each print statement occured. Run the program, and examine the
                  output. Ask yourself each time a variable changes whether its
                  starting and new values make sense. (You don't need to work out
                  the exact values of the variables to figure out if they make
                  sense in this case.) Once you've found the problem, you may want
                  to move the declarations of some variables farther inside your
                  loops to the first point you need them. Declaring variables as
                  late as possible is one strategy to avoid the type of bug you
                  are encountering. (Video is slowed for illustration.)

                  <div>
                    <p>You are redrawing the background before drawing each
                    planet, instead of redrawing it once per timestep. As a result,
                    you keep covering up each planet as soon as you draw it.</p>
                  </div>
          <h3>My planets "smear" accross the screen.</h3>
          <div>
            <p>You are drawing
                        the background once at the beginning of the programming instead
                        of once each time step. Processing does not erase the window
                        automatically. In this program, we're never erasing it at all.
                        Instead, we keep covering the old planet positions up with the
                        starfield image, which happens to be exactly the same size as
                        the window. If you don't keep redrawing the background before
                        drawing the planets at their new positions, the old planets are
                        still there, causing the smearing effect.</p>
