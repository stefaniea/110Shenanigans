                                  The leapfrog
                                  method is more stable for integrating Hamiltonian systems than
                                  conventional numerical methods like Euler's method or
                                  Runge-Kutta. The leapfrog method is <em>symplectic</em>, which
                                  means it preserves properties specific to Hamiltonian systems
                                  (conservation of linear and angular momentum,
                                  time-reversibility, and conservation of energy of the discrete
                                  Hamiltonian). In contrast, ordinary numerical methods become
                                  dissipative and exhibit qualitatively different long-term
                                  behavior. For example, the earth would slowly spiral into (or
                                  away from) the sun. For these reasons, symplectic methods are
                                  extremely popular for N-body calculations in practice. (Yeah,
                                  it's a bit complex.&nbsp; Hey, you asked!)
                                  <p> Here's a more complete explanation of how you should
                                    interpret the variables. The classic <em>Euler method</em>
                                    updates the position uses the velocity at time <em>t</em>
                                    instead of using the updated velocity at time <em>t</em> + Δ<em>t</em>.
                                    A better idea is to use the velocity at the midpoint <em>t</em>
                                    + Δ<em>t</em> / 2. The leapfrog method does this in a clever
                                    way. It maintains the position and velocity one-half time step
                                    out of phase: At the beginning of an iteration, (<em>p<sub>x</sub></em>,
                                    <em>p<sub>y</sub></em>) represents the position at time <em>t</em>
                                    and (<em>v<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>v<sub>y</sub></em>)
                                    represents the velocity at time <em>t</em> - Δt / 2.
                                    Interpreting the position and velocity in this way, the
                                    updated position (<em>p<sub>x</sub></em> + Δ<em>t</em> <em>v<sub>x</sub></em>,
                                    <em>p<sub>y</sub></em> + Δ<em>t</em> <em>v<sub>y</sub></em>).
                                    uses the velocity at time <em>t</em> + Δt / 2. Almost
                                    magically, the only special care needed to deal with the half
                                    time-steps is to initialize the system's velocity at time <em>t</em>
                                    = -Δ<em>t</em> / 2 (instead of <em>t</em> = 0.0), and you can
                                    assume that we have already done this for you. Note also that
                                    the acceleration is computed at time <em>t</em> so that when
                                    we update the velocity, we are using the acceleration at the
                                    midpoint of the interval under consideration. </p>

   <li>N-body simulations play a crucial role in our understanding of
    the universe. Astrophysicists use it to study stellar dynamics
    at the galactic center, stellar dynamics in a globular cluster,
    colliding galaxies, and the formation of the structure of the
    Universe. The strongest evidence we have for the belief that
    there is a black hole in the center of the Milky Way comes from
    very accurate N-body simulations. Many of the problems that
    astrophysicists want to solve have millions or billions of
    particles. More sophisticated computational techniques are
    needed.
    <!-- We will revisit one such approach in the final project. -->
  </li>
  <li class="slide">The same methods are also widely used in molecular dynamics,
    except that the heavenly bodies are replaced by atoms, gravity
    is replaced by some other force, and the leapfrog method is
    called <em>Verlet's method</em>. With van der Waals forces, the
    interaction energy may decay as 1/R^6 instead of an inverse
    square law. Occasionally, 3-way interactions must be taken into
    account, e.g., to account for the covalent bonds in diamond
    crystals.

 To simulate bulk pieces of matter (10^23 atoms) scientists often use periodic
 boundary conditions since it's not possible to simulate nearly that many
 atoms.--> </li>
